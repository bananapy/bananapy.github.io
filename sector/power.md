# India's electricity demand, generation capacity and opportunities

## Demand
India’s demand for energy is set to double by 2040, and its electricity demand may triple, according to the report. The country’s oil consumption is expected to grow faster than that of any other major economy.
India’s goals include increasing its power generation capacity from renewables from 80 gigawatts today to 175 gigawatts by 2022 – and eventually to 450 gigawatts in the long term.
